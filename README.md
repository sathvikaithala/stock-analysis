# Stocks Analysis
Module 2 Challenge

### Challenge 

In this challenge, we were tasked with performing analysis on 12 different stocks. Metrics we were looking for included Daily Total Volume and the Return for various years. We scripted macros to automate this process. After creating a working file, we were tasked with refactoring the code to make it run more efficiently.

**Refactoring pending completion.**
